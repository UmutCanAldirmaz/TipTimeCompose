# Tip Time - A Tip Calculator App ⏱️💸

Welcome to **Tip Time** 🎉, a simple and intuitive tip calculator app built with **Kotlin** 🌀 and **Jetpack Compose** 🚀. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of state management in a Compose-based Android application while providing a practical tool to calculate tip amounts based on service costs. 🌟

## Project Summary 📝

In this app:
- **State** refers to any value that can change over time. ⏳
- The **Composition** is the UI description created by Compose when it executes composable functions, transforming data into a user interface. 🖼️
- **Initial Composition** happens when Compose builds the UI for the first time by running composable functions. 🎨
- **Recomposition** occurs when the same composables are rerun to update the UI tree after data changes. 🔄
- **State Hoisting** is applied as a pattern to move state to the caller, making components stateless and reusable. 📦

The app allows users to input a service amount and calculates the tip based on predefined logic, showcasing how Compose handles state and UI updates efficiently. ✅

## What You'll Build 🛠️

With this project, you will create **Tip Time**, a tip-calculator app that:
- Takes a service amount as input. ✍️
- Calculates and displays the tip amount dynamically. 💰

## Prerequisites 📚

To understand and work with this project, you should have:
- A basic understanding of **Jetpack Compose**, including the `@Composable` annotation. 🧩
- Familiarity with basic Compose layouts like `Row` and `Column`. 📏
- Knowledge of **Modifiers**, such as `Modifier.padding()`. 🎛️
- Experience with the `Text` composable. 📜

## What You'll Learn 🎓

By exploring this project, you’ll gain insights into:
- How to think about **state** in a UI. 🤔
- How **Compose** leverages state to display and update data. 📈
- Adding a **text box** to your app for user input. ⌨️
- Applying **state hoisting** to improve composable reusability. 🔧
- Handling **scrolling behavior** when the app is rotated sideways. 📱
- Using **icons in text fields** to enhance the UI. ✨

## How It Works ⚙️
1. Enter the service amount in the text box. ✏️
2. The app calculates the tip based on the input and updates the UI automatically using Compose’s recomposition. 🔍
3. State is hoisted to the caller to keep the UI components stateless and reusable. 🏗️
