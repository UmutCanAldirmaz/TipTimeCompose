# Tip Time - A Tip Calculator App

Welcome to **Tip Time**, a simple and intuitive tip calculator app built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of state management in a Compose-based Android application while providing a practical tool to calculate tip amounts based on service costs.

## Project Summary

In this app:
- **State** refers to any value that can change over time.
- The **Composition** is the UI description created by Compose when it executes composable functions, transforming data into a user interface.
- **Initial Composition** happens when Compose builds the UI for the first time by running composable functions.
- **Recomposition** occurs when the same composables are rerun to update the UI tree after data changes.
- **State Hoisting** is applied as a pattern to move state to the caller, making components stateless and reusable.

The app allows users to input a service amount and calculates the tip based on predefined logic, showcasing how Compose handles state and UI updates efficiently.

## What You'll Build

With this project, you will create **Tip Time**, a tip-calculator app that:
- Takes a service amount as input.
- Calculates and displays the tip amount dynamically.

## Prerequisites

To understand and work with this project, you should have:
- A basic understanding of **Jetpack Compose**, including the `@Composable` annotation.
- Familiarity with basic Compose layouts like `Row` and `Column`.
- Knowledge of **Modifiers**, such as `Modifier.padding()`.
- Experience with the `Text` composable.

## What You'll Learn

By exploring this project, youâ€™ll gain insights into:
- How to think about **state** in a UI.
- How **Compose** leverages state to display and update data.
- Adding a **text box** to your app for user input.
- Applying **state hoisting** to improve composable reusability.
- Handling **scrolling behavior** when the app is rotated sideways.
- Using **icons in text fields** to enhance the UI.
