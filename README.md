# Tip Time - A Tip Calculator App

Welcome to **Tip Time**, a simple and intuitive tip calculator app built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of state management in a Compose-based Android application while providing a practical tool to calculate tip amounts based on service costs.

## Project Summary

In this app:
- **State** refers to any value that can change over time.
- The **Composition** is the UI description created by Compose when it executes composable functions, transforming data into a user interface.
- **Initial Composition** happens when Compose builds the UI for the first time by running composable functions.
- **Recomposition** occurs when the same composables are rerun to update the UI tree after data changes.
- **State Hoisting** is applied as a pattern to move state to the caller, making components stateless and reusable.

The app allows users to input a service amount and calculates the tip based on predefined logic, showcasing how Compose handles state and UI updates efficiently.

## What You'll Build

With this project, you will create **Tip Time**, a tip-calculator app that:
- Takes a service amount as input.
- Calculates and displays the tip amount dynamically.

## Prerequisites

To understand and work with this project, you should have:
- A basic understanding of **Jetpack Compose**, including the `@Composable` annotation.
- Familiarity with basic Compose layouts like `Row` and `Column`.
- Knowledge of **Modifiers**, such as `Modifier.padding()`.
- Experience with the `Text` composable.

## What You'll Learn

By exploring this project, you’ll gain insights into:
- How to think about **state** in a UI.
- How **Compose** leverages state to display and update data.
- Adding a **text box** to your app for user input.
- Applying **state hoisting** to improve composable reusability.
- Handling **scrolling behavior** when the app is rotated sideways.
- Using **icons in text fields** to enhance the UI.

## How It Works
1. Enter the service amount in the text box.
2. The app calculates the tip based on the input and updates the UI automatically using Compose’s recomposition.
3. State is hoisted to the caller to keep the UI components stateless and reusable.
